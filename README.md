## 💡 Future Feature Suggestions
This project provides a solid foundation. Here are some ideas for future enhancements to make it even more comprehensive:
### Advanced Payroll Logic:
- Implement prorated salary calculations for new or leaving employees.
- Integrate tax calculations (PPh 21) based on government regulations.
- Add overtime pay calculations based on attendance data.
### Enhanced Dashboard:
- Add charts and graphs to visualize data, such as employee demographics, attendance trends, or leave statistics.
- Create a "To-Do" widget for HR/Admins (e.g., pending leave requests, expiring contracts).
### Performance & Goals Module:
- Allow managers to set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for their team members.
- Implement a feature for periodic performance reviews and feedback.
### "Forgot Password" Feature:
- Implement a secure password reset flow using email verification tokens.
### Audit Log:
- Create a logging system that tracks important actions (e.g., who changed an employee's salary, who approved a leave request).
### Third-Party Integrations:
- Integrate with accounting software (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks) to streamline financial reporting.
- Connect with messaging platforms like Slack or WhatsApp for notifications.
### Mobile App Support:
- Develop a lightweight mobile application (e.g., using React Native) for employees to easily check-in/out and request leaves.
### Testing:
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like Jest and Supertest to ensure code reliability and stability.
